## 📋 Prerequisites

- Mechanical dice throwing equipment
- Dice counter with 5-line output interface
- Power supply (5V DC)
- Basic electronic tools for installation
- LCD display units (6x)

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Hardware Setup**
   - Mount the circuit board in a suitable enclosure
   - Connect power supply (5V DC)
   - Attach LCD displays to designated ports
   - Connect dice counter output to input terminals

2. **System Integration**
   ```
   Input Connections:
   - PIN 1-4: Dice number input
   - PIN 5: Sample availability signal
   - GND: Common ground
   - VCC: 5V power supply
   ```

3. **Testing**
   - Power on the system
   - Verify all LCD displays are functional
   - Run a test sequence using manual inputs
   - Validate counter accuracy

## 💻 Usage Instructions

1. Ensure all power connections are secure
2. Power on the mechanical dice throwing equipment
3. Initialize the dice counter system
4. Start the dice throwing sequence
5. Monitor real-time results on LCD displays
6. Record or analyze data as needed

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **No Display Output**: Check power connections and LCD interface cables
- **Incorrect Counts**: Verify input signal timing and connections
- **System Reset**: Use the manual reset switch if counting errors occur
- **Display Flickering**: Check power supply stability
