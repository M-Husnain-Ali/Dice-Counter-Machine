## üîß Installation & Setup

1. **Software Setup**
   - Install LogicWorks on your system
   - Open `Dice Counter Project.cct` using LogicWorks
   - Verify all components are properly loaded

2. **Hardware Setup**
   - Mount the circuit board in a suitable enclosure
   - Connect power supply (5V DC)
   - Attach LCD displays to designated ports
   - Connect dice counter output to input terminals

3. **System Integration**
   ```
   Input Connections:
   - PIN 1-4: Dice number input
   - PIN 5: Sample availability signal
   - GND: Common ground
   - VCC: 5V power supply
   ```

4. **Testing**
   - Power on the system
   - Verify all LCD displays are functional
   - Run a test sequence using manual inputs
   - Validate counter accuracy

## üíª Usage Instructions

1. Ensure all power connections are secure
2. Power on the mechanical dice throwing equipment
